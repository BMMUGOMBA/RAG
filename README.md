# RAG
A hands-on repository to learn, build, and evaluate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)â€”from the simplest keyword search to a production-grade, cite-what-you-say assistant. Designed for fast learning, clear comparisons, and easy swap-outs (LLMs, embedders, retrievers, rerankers, vector DBs).
